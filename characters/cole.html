                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Cole is confident, she's usually pretty lucky and always goes into situations expecting them to work out. When something doesn't go her way Cole takes it in stride and adapts by making a new plan rather than brewing on how it went wrong. Cole thinks very 'in the moment' and is not a reflective person which causes her to repeat mistakes. Cole has a very hot temper which most often manifests as yelling, but everyone involved understands that it's more of a performance than a real anger (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lKqk4h9mmi8" target="_blank">a perfect example is the replenish video)</a>. She can also be devious and can be mean spirited or spiteful with someone she truly despises. Cole will go out of her way to be manipulative and attempt to socially humiliate a person. Cole thinks this is normal behavior and is skeptical when it comes to meeting new people or being around others that she can't get a good read on.</p>
                <p>Cole has a prevaling sense of right and wrong guided by an underdeveloped without nuance </p>

                <br>
                <h3>Cole's Powers</h3>
                <p>When Cole was summoned by Sun it was though a spell that would turn her into a demigod. The spell went awry when Theodore's blood was accidentally mixed with the sacrifice's instead of her own instead of her own. Cole was still granted the soul and power of the demigod. But without the mixing of the sacrifice's blood Cole could not properly mesh her psychi, or easily overpower demigod's soul inside her. This means that without concentration the demigod can take control of her body and actions.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>Why is she pink?</h3>
                <p>Cole is pink because when I first designed the character I choose pink because at the time I was tiered of drawing natural skin color. A year or two later when she became established as a character and not just a design I left it because I was still tiered of drawing normal skin. I draw new art of her is with a human skin tone but most of her art on the page predates that decision.</p>

                <div class="cole-text-box w3-justify" style=" max-height: 40vh; overflow: auto;">
                <p>Cole’s story begins when she is summoned naked on a cold stone slab in a church in Weilheim. She’s tasked by Sun with using her knowledge of the arcane to craft a spell capable of forcibly summoning Moon from her domain allowing Sun to take her throne. Cole is summoned emaciated and too dehydrated to talk. Sun attempts to talk with her but she can not understand. Over the next couple days she gains some strength back while she watches over Theodore's unconscious body (who at this point is not sure if he is a boy or girl). Sun informs the two their final destination is the Lekle Republic where they will be taken very good care of because he is good friends with the king. Cole realizes that they are being kidnapped and attempts to run away unsuccessfully when Sun threatens to kill Theodore if Cole runs away again. After a couple weeks of travel they make it to a dock where they board a ship for a month to sail across the coast to another country. During the travel and boat time Cole learns to speak some of the native tongue and developes more of a bond with Theodore and Sun. They arrive at the port where the group makes there way down to their final destination. Cole and Theodore devise a plan to steal Sun's write of authorization. At the border to Lekle they blindside Sun by presenting it as their own and pretending not to know Sun. The two travel together back to Theodore's home country while Sun makes his way back to Lekle's capital in chains. After arriving at the capital Sun eventually re-unites with the Young King and is given the location of a demi-god who Sun apprehends and uses to track Cole.</p>

       <h5>Pre-Gaming (Backstory)</h5>
                <p>Cole was chosen because she was an estranged disciple of the language god. Left at the temple as a sacrifice Cole was taken in and raised by the priests outside the temple. She was eventually expected to enter the temple and receive the god's blessing but did so reluctantly. As a disciple Cole was allowed pilgrimage, and joined a convoy to a demigod's domain. The domain turned out to be a human farm where she was penned in until being summoned by Sun. She was chosen for a few reasons,</p> 
                
                <p style="line-height: 1.2em; margin-left:1em; margin-top: -1em">
                <br>A. Cole was in the closest domain and near death, making her soul & body less resistant to physical transfer  
                <br>B. Cole was a disciple which is a requirement for the spell  
                <br>C. Cole was inside the domain meaning that whatever happened to her would be unnoticed by any of the Seven.</p>
