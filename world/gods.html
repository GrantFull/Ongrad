                Demi-gods are sentient creatures gifted powers by any number of the Seven Gods. They are functionally immortal as their bodies do not degrade from the passage of time when in their domain. They reside in the domain that they are linked to but can leave it at will. Their domains are a reflection of the demi-god, the god which blessed the demi-god, and the surrounding biome. They do not interact very much with the world outside of their domains.

                <p class="w3-small">
                    A god employs demi-gods and denizens, a denizen is always one of the gifted races. A denizen is created when a god blesses someone, that being's mind and body will be altered by the deities. Which ever gift the god represent will be taken from the denizen, i.e. a language god's blessing will remove the persons ability to speak and understand language. Denizens most often stay in their god's temple but are most often treated with great reverence when outside their temple. Denizens have extended lifespans and increased strength.

            <p class="w3-small">
                Deities are linked to biomes, a domain is a reflection of its deity. Demi-gods control the domains and have control over what goes on and who comes into their domains. It is much more difficult to get into a domain than it is to get out, a being must be invited into the domain by its deity. Domains very in size, they can be anywhere from dozens of square miles to an acre of land. From they outside looking in they appear to just be a colorful shimmer if they can be seen at all. They take up actual real space and are physically blocked off from the world by an translucent magic barrier. A deity sets up a barrier by drawing a closed loop with their magical chalk. After the loop is drawn the barrier goes up and the domain begins to form to reflect what the residing deity desires. Because they are reflections of their deity they can often be different from the surrounding area.

                When a god gives their blessing to an animal the animal will gain that attribute which they had not previously had. For example: if a frog is blessed by the god of language it will gain the ability to learn and speak languages. When a god gives their blessing to a sharp creature a double positive is created and they will loose that attribute which they already had. For example: if a human is blessed by the god of language they will loose the ability to speak or understand language.
            </p>
            <p class="w3-small">
                Each of the seven represent an attribute specific to sharp creatures. The god's are unable to meet face to face because leaving their domain's means putting their lives at risk. Gods create demi-gods to perform tasks and commuincate with one another. Their temples are filled with their worshipers and devout followers. A piramid of importance can represent the mass of a god's temple: at the bottom is generic sharp worshipers, they have no special connection to their god and are often comming and going or making pilgramges. Then are the denizens of another god, the amount of which veries depending on the god nessesities. For instance, the denizens of the god of agriculture who can not farm for themselves, would need the deniziens of another god to farm for them. The language god would need the most imported denizens becuase his denizens would loose the ability to speak or understand language and therefore be mostly useless. Imported denizens can not be completely trusted in the same way as a denizine of one's own so they stay low in the totem of power. Next on the perverbial priamid would be denizens of one's own. At the top are demi-gods, animals given the gift by two or more gods.

            <p class="w3-small">
                The seven Continental deities are the greatest power, they control entire continents under their domain. They are largely indifferent and reclusive and don’t interact much with the outside world. They are the only deities actually referred to as gods, and their denizens are referred to as disciples. Each of the seven altars those who it chooses in a specific way such that any normal being can recognize them and relate them to a specific of the Seven. Cole is sort of an exception because she starves herself in an effort to distance herself from her god. The god of the western half of the south continent is Cole’s god, a possessive eldritch that normally takes the form of a woman. The disciples of this god are what Cole’s natural form looks like: tall, horned, cloven hooved, with a large tail and wings. The god of Gwin’s islands is a large bird, and the altered bodies of Gwin’s disciples can be singled out by their feathers. The god of the cradle continent is intellectual and has a love of linguistics, which is the reason why the continent only uses one written language. Becoming the disciple of more than one god is forbidden, a god will not take in a disciple of another god if the disciple is one of the sentient species. If a being is the disciple of at least two gods then it can perform a deietic ritual, and draw a domain to become a deity. This can happen one of two ways, either with the permission of the god or by tricking the god without their permission. The first way is the safest as it does not incur the wrath of the Seven, it is reserved for dull creatures and involves a few steps. First a god in want of a deity will contact at least one other god and request their aid in making a new deity. The god will choose a dull being such as a gecko, wolf, or any other creature without intellect. They will put them in a crate and send them to the one or more other gods involved. Those gods upon receiving the creature will perform the rites making the creature their disciple. The creature will gain intelligence, power, and attributes of the god from this, it will be caged again and sent to the next god if there are more. Once the last god in the agreement has performed their rites, the creature will be sent back to the original god for the final ceremony. At this time the creature may be incredibly difficult to contain and dangerous if let loose, so a tight watch and many guards (usually disciples of the original god) are placed upon it. Finally with the creature back the original god will perform the last set of rites, making it their disciple. The god moves the creature somewhere inside their domain, then performs the deictic ritual for it and draws out its domain. From there the creature will find itself, altering its body and domain until it settles into its existence of a deity. The other way to become a deity is for sharp creatures (creatures who are able to learn two languages). If a being manages to trick a god into becoming their disciple despite being the disciple of another god then that being has the power to become a deity. Once a being is a disciple of multiple gods they are known as unfaithful and will be punished if found out by the gods. The more gods they trick the more power said being will become when it performs the deictic ritual and draws their own domain.

They reside in a monumental palace befitting the god of creation deep in the mountain jungles of their continent. Their palace is of white marble with inlays of gold and emerald. The god is assosciated with order, tools, buildings, and clothes.</p>

                <h4>Domain</h4>
                <p>Their domain is the southern continent, one of my favorite places on the world I created. Because the area encompasses the pole a year is the same as a day. The plants are all perennial, as the long day begins their seeds which have all been dormant begin to sprout. Most leaves are dark to black in order to absorb the most daylight the quickest, they grow astoundingly tall to outpace their competition. They grow incredibly quickly thanks to both the endless stream of sunlight and the massive amounts of rains caused by cool ocean air rushing into the hot sun baked land. As the day ends they drop their seeds, die, and wait the winter to begin the cycle anew. In many areas plant debris as hight as a grown man's knee litters the ground. Spores which have lain dormant during the day germinate as the night begins. With the mass of fresh debris the fungi too grow into incredible proportions. As the night ends the mushrooms release their spores filling the sky with the finest snow.</p>

                <p>Animals live in the world in which they are born into, they do not create tools to alter how they are able to interact with their environment, they do not build structures to shield them from the outside world, the do not create clothes to keep them safe. These are things a demi-god of creation would have the capacity for. conversely, disciples had already been gifted with creation would loose their capacity for those things. This does not mean that they would be unable to live in houses or wear clothes, just as a dog or any other animal can enter a house and enjoy its luxurious so too could disciples. Their inability would lie in their ability to create rather than use tools, clothes, and structures.</p>

They reside over the south continent, sharing the land mass with another god, equally split down the center.

                <h3><i>Sun meets the Grey Beast</i></h3>
                    <p>&emsp;Sun enters into the gray beasts domain, he can immediately sense entering the presence of a deity, a presence which conceals his magic from the Seven. He clicks the lock and hesitantly removes his necklace. With a few dozen words he casts an insignificant canter causing a nearly imperceptible amount of smoke to escape his nostrils. He waits holding the necklace above his head. Minutes pass in silence as he braces for a god to collapse the world in around him. But no retribution comes. Sun closes his eyes chanting in another, older language. His throat swells, his eyes bulge, smoke seeps out of his nose, and from between his teeth. The smoke gets heavier, thicker, more viscous the air smells pungent of burning ash wood. His voice raises and echoes, he falls to his knees and clutches at his chest and throat without breaking his rhythmic chant. The wind picks up pushing the smoke that threatens to choke him into the air above. Sun's voice abruptly cuts off, the last of the smoke trailing through his teeth to join the rest of the cloud. His demeanor changes, a bottomless unrighteous arrogance subtly morphs into a unchecked unbound confidence. His leering becomes looming that shrinks the sky around him.<br>
                    &emsp;Sun cracks his wrists and wets his lips. He clears his throat. "I call upon the deity which resides in this domain!" Sun shouts in no particular direction other than up. The wind rustles the trees but Sun gets no answer. He follows a stream up to a more densely forested area and demands the deity's presence once again. "I know you're around here, I can feel you. How many of the Seven did you visit before you came here? No more than three I'd wager, come out and let me have a look at you"<br>
                    &emsp;In response a bassy roar shakes the trees and resonates Sun's sternum like a tuning fork. Accompanying the roar in the shadows of the trees are a pair of large eyes that are too high up and too far apart. The creature looms as it stalks on broad shoulders crushing the wooded areas underfoot, breaking enough branches to imitate the crackling of a bonfire as it walks into view out of the thicket. First an arm, a burly arm coated in long, coarse, gray hair that spans for meters. Its hand is orange which resembles Sun's own hand: four fingers and a thumb with three accompanying joints on each finger. Sun spreads his arms in a disarming gesture as he begins chanting low and quiet. The gray beast's eyes narrow, it follows into view with its second arm, torso and hind legs. The beast's head is small, its eyes dark and beady, its face covered in fur save for its orange bill. The creature is a behemoth standing an imposing 4 meters tall, its hind hands anatomically identical to the ones in the front. Without breaking eye contact Sun backpedals but the gray beast slowly closes the distance, stalking nearer to Sun on its four legs. Its hackles rise and its long tail sways back and forth. The closer it gets the faster Sun's rhythmic chants and the lower the beast's head shrinks beneath its shoulder blades. The predator moves its hips closer to the ground like a gray spring of sinew loading tension. Sun, just as abruptly as the time before, ceases chanting.<br>
                    &emsp;The beast collapses, its knees buckle and it claws at the dirt but finds no purchase. Sun draws his breath and begins another spell, the beast turns in fear and crawls away getting back onto its feet. Sun chants creating thousands of blue transparent gloved hands that appear in flashes clearing the surrounding area of debris. They pull leaves off trees, remove twigs, and pull plants up by their roots from the ground. In the pattern of a small rectangle around his feet, the hands etch symbols in the dirt. The hands dissipate, Sun empties the smoke from his lungs and takes in a breath of clean air. He continues chanting to create four lines of hieroglyphs. Each of the new lines propagating from the center of one of the four lines forming the established square, and each hieroglyphic line facing one of the four cardinal directions. The lines of glyphs open veins in his arms pooling blood in the air. In the seconds it takes to gather his blood the hieroglyphs surrounding him are etched deep into the dirt and stonic writings are uniformly pressed into the dirt in a wide circle connecting with the four outcroppings of writing. A haze appears around him, smoke billows and tendrils slither and shoot out of the four sections inside the circle grabbing nearby life: bunnies, lizards, and birds are brought in the circle surrounding him. An unseen force crushes the animals together, their blood mixes and seeps with an unnatural quickness through the newly etched troughs in the dirt. Sun kneels to place his palms on the ground, they mix with the blood and smoke rises from the dirt out through the space between his fingers. His words reach inhuman speeds as he enters the spell's crescendo. Without warning Sun's voice cuts off, his lips forming words silently under the concentration of smoke. The blood of Sun and the creatures sink into the ground and in the distance the beast howls.<br>
                    &emsp;Sun clutches his stomach with both of his arms, his forehead against the dirt. Ecstasy from the return to magic and adrenaline from the encounter mixes inside him turning his stomach. He laughs psychotically, drool running up his cheeks. He gathers himself, he wipes his face clean with his dirty hands and stands up straight. He follows in the direction of the roar until he finds the gray beast. He stands over the beast as it violently struggles against the newfound fetters shackling its limbs to the ground.</p>
