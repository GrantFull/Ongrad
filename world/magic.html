The summers are hot enough to dry up rivers and parch lakes. Two continents complement each other as they swim in the 7 great seas. Flora adapted to heartyer to sustain the seasons, or weaker to die off waiting dormant beneath the frozen ground. Fauna developed to cope with days & nights lasting months.</p>

                    <p>Symbolic: This magic is capable of doing anything capable by a single normal human, it is the quickest and easiest to create spells for but produces the most smoke.</p>
                    <p>Hieroglyphic: This magic is capable of performing any physical task. It is the second easiest to create spells and produces the second most amount of smoke.</p>
                    <p>Runic: Anything except for creating something from nothing and vice versa, or creating life. It produces the second least amount of smoke.</p>
                    <p>Stonic: Anything is possible, this is the most powerful magic but also the most difficult spells to create. Produces the least smoke. Think of magic from history (most specifically icelandic tradtions), First the magicina will carve symbols then the magician's blood, or the blood of an animal</p>

            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <p>There are a few occasions when magic is not an option.</p>
            <p>
                1. On the open ocean: it is known that leviathans can lay under the surface, and sink any boat where magic is practiced. Even on beaches or docks small parties magicians have been known to disappear.
                <br>
                2. Magic nullifiers: These items subtly distort reality in ways that effect spells ability to function.
                <br>
                3. Unfaithfuls: If an intelligent beast receives the blessing of more than one of the seven gods they are considered unfaithful. When an unfaithful practices magic imbued with multiple god's blessings, the presiding god will take notice and kill the transgressor. 
                <br><br>
                &emsp;There are two exceptions to the above rule: 
                <br>&emsp;A. Inside any domain of a demigod.
                <br>&emsp;B. Inside domain of Ubiquity. Ubiquity is the most powerful god and does not share the monogamous opinions of the other gods. They will freely give their blessing to anyone who requests it even if they have already received one from another god.
            </p>
            <h3>Magical Items</h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;Items imbued with magic emit a fog which falls as opposed to rising like the magical smoke. The fog gives off the same sent as the magician's smoke who cast the spell upon the item. Magical items are common and come in all forms. Most are for everyday use but the interesting ones are for combat, both offensive and defensive. 
                <br>
                &emsp;Magic nullifiers: Magic nullifiers are objects created my magicians that can alter the conditions in a radius around them. The nature of spells can change depending on outside physical conditions, these items subtly distort reality in ways that effect spells. A common example is a ring that changes the humidity around its bearer. Multiple magic nullifiers can be worn at the same time making it increasingly difficult for would be attackers to counter the effects. Because magical items create a fog, a large amount of nullifiers cover an area in mist.

            <h2>Magic</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>No permanent drawback for magic use, when someone uses magic smoke is created in their lungs and escapes out their mouth and nose. If a magician holds a spell for too long or attempts a spell that produces more smoke than they can hold their breath for then they could die.</li>
                <li>No tools needed aside from the user's knowledge and something to write on</li>
                <li>Magic is learned like any other craft, through studying and doing</li>
                <li>All people are capable of learning magic but some people are more naturally gifted than others the same as any other skill.</li>
                <li>All things are possible with stonic magic, to bring someone back to life with a fresh body is possible but only for professionals and to resurrect someone without a body is theoretically possible but never been done. A resurrection spell would take a team of very skilled unspecialized magicians about a year to create the spell specific to the person. There are bands of magicians who specialize specific kinds of magic who roam the continent searching for a willing buyer. In the case of a resurrection a team of 5 magicians could create a spell in average 2 weeks. The more outside of the realm of nature an action is, the more smoke it requires, if it requires to much smoke, it is impossible for normal humans.</li>
                <li>It is not possible to permanently take someone's magical abilities away, however enchanted items can prevent magic use when worn.</li>
                <li>Magic is largely a scholarly pursuit meaning that generally the older the practitioner, the more skilled the magician. However as a person gets too old their lung capacity diminishes and their magical ability with it.</li>
                <li>Emotions do not effect magical ability.</li>
            </ol>
