The summers are hot enough to dry up rivers and parch lakes. Two continents complement each other as they swim in the 7 great seas. Flora adapted to heartyer to sustain the seasons, or weaker to die off waiting dormant beneath the frozen ground. Fauna developed to cope with days & nights lasting months.</p>

            <h2>Creation Myth</h2>
                <p class="justify">In the beginning, Ongrad was a flat and barren across the whole of the world laid cracked clay beds. The surface had no water, no life, not even any mountains. Ongrad suffered no motion, it did not spin, it did not circle around the sun, and its moon lay still in the sky above. No eyes suffered the sight of this desolation but they would be of no use since the unending days suffered pitch darkness. The sky was magnificent, in its primordial form the heavens contained all life. First the wind began to blow a massive downdraft. It lifted on the cracks in the land and tore them asunder.  The winds blew the soft dry land into mountains and valleys. They blew so hard that Ongrad began to spin faster until the world itself started to move and the moon with it. The downdraft gave way to rain, which turned the sand into solid earth packed with the force of the rain. The water filled the lowlands, forming oceans, rivers, and lakes, and nourishing the parched earth. Life began to emerge from the once barren land. Plants sprouted, animals appeared, and soon the world was teeming with life. Where lightning struck the veins of ore were created, hail cratered deep into the ground creating aquifers and springs, where snow fell meadows of soft grass sprouted. When the sky ran out of water it gave its lifeblood this created all the creatures of the land. The red blood that pooled would become humans, the white blood became apes, the brown blood became dwarves, and the green blood became orcs. Most often these different bloods would mix together this formed all the creatures of lesser intelligence and stature. Different amounts and types of blood created different creatures. When the sky had given its last drop the earth began to dry, the mountains solidified and the pools of lifeblood congealed into the creatures of Ongrad.</p>

            <h2>Creation Myth</h2>
            <p class="w3-justify">In the beginning a frog and salamander inhabited the earth. The frog Garp roamed the earth by day and by night slept in lakes, rivers and the ocean. The salamander is the color of fire and molten rock. It chased the frog every night and slept during the day. The frog was constantly running from the salamander because the Garp knew that if it was caught the salamander would try to eat him. The salamander never rested or slowed but he was much slower than the frog. Garp jumped over the mountains and into the valleys, every day he got farther and farther from the salamander. But he would rest for one week until the salamander would catch up. Garp would wait till Just before the salamander would close his maw on the frog, before leaping out of the way to taunt him. On a particularly hot day the frog was feeling sluggish, it jumped into a bath of boiling black tar to rest. The days grew hotter and the long week was coming to a close as the salamander approached. As the salamander approached, Garp got ready to leap away but the tar held it in a firm grip. Despite the tar the salamander never slowed and as it came closer it unhinged its jaw. The frog flexed its legs and as it jumped the salamander caught hold of its tail. Propelled by the tension of the sludge and the pain of the bite the frog lept so high it reached the sky. Garp became the moon and the salamander became the sun. The salamander still chases but the frog learned its lesson and moves slow enough to not need rest.</p>
